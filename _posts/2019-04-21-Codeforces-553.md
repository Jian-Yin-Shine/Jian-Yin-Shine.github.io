### A. Maxim and Biology

Today in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, there was a biology lesson. The topic of the lesson was the *genomes*. Let's call the *genome* the string "ACTG".

Maxim was very boring to sit in class, so the teacher came up with a task for him: on a given string 𝑠s consisting of uppercase letters and length of at least 4, you need to find the minimum number of *operations* that you need to apply, so that the *genome* appears in it as a substring. For one *operation*, you can replace any letter in the string 𝑠s with the next or previous in the alphabet. For example, for the letter "D" the previous one will be "C", and the next — "E". In this problem, we assume that for the letter "A", the previous one will be the letter "Z", and the next one will be "B", and for the letter "Z", the previous one is the letter "Y", and the next one is the letter "A".

Help Maxim solve the problem that the teacher gave him.

A string 𝑎 is a substring of a string 𝑏 if 𝑎a can be obtained from 𝑏 by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

```c++
// 翻译，将一个字符串修改成含有ACTG子串的最少步数，每次修改只能将一个字母修改成前一个，或者后一个。
#include <stdio.h>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
char str[55];
int calc(int p) {
    int res = 0;
    res += min(abs(str[p] - 'A'), 26-abs(str[p]-'A'));
    res += min(abs(str[p+1] - 'C'), 26-abs(str[p+1]-'C'));
    res += min(abs(str[p+2]-'T'), 26-abs(str[p+2]-'T'));
    res += min(abs(str[p+3]-'G'), 26-abs(str[p+3] - 'G'));
    return res;
}
int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d%s",&n, str);
    int ans = 0x3f3f3f3f;
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 4 + 1; i++) {
        ans = min(ans, calc(i));
    }
    printf("%d\n", ans);
    return 0;
}
```



### B. Dima and a Bad XOR

Student Dima from Kremland has a matrix 𝑎a of size 𝑛×𝑚 filled with non-negative integers.

He wants to select exactly one integer from each row of the matrix so that the bitwise exclusive OR of the selected integers is strictly greater than zero. Help him!

Formally, he wants to choose an integers sequence 𝑐1,𝑐2,…,𝑐𝑛 (1≤𝑐𝑗≤𝑚) so that the inequality 𝑎1,𝑐1⊕𝑎2,𝑐2⊕…⊕𝑎𝑛,𝑐𝑛>0holds, where 𝑎𝑖,𝑗 is the matrix element from the 𝑖-th row and the 𝑗-th column.

Here 𝑥⊕𝑦x⊕y denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of integers 𝑥 and 𝑦.

```python
# 翻译: 有n*m 的矩阵，从每一行挑出一个数，他们能否最后异或值是否大于0，大于零则依次输出他们的ci
# 先把第一列异或起来，如果等于零，只要在同一行中找到一个和第一个不同的即可。代替他。
n, m = [ int(i) for i in input().split() ]
ls = []
for i in range(n):
    ls.append([int(i) for i in input().split() ])

ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans^=ls[i][0]
res = []
if ans != 0:
    res = [ 1 for i in range(n) ]
else :
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if ls[i][0]!=ls[i][j]:
                # python 合并列表用 +
                res+=[1 for k in range(i)]
                res.append(j+1)
                res+=[1 for k in range(i+1, n)]
                break
        if len(res) > 0:
            break

if len(res) == 0:
    print('NIE')
else :
    print('TAK')
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print("")
```



### D. Stas and the Queue at the Buffet

During a break in the buffet of the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, there was formed a queue of 𝑛 high school students numbered from 1 to 𝑛. Initially, each student 𝑖 is on position 𝑖. Each student 𝑖 is characterized by two numbers — 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖. *Dissatisfaction* of the person 𝑖 equals the product of 𝑎𝑖 by the number of people standing to the left of his position, add the product 𝑏𝑖 by the number of people standing to the right of his position. Formally, the *dissatisfaction* of the student 𝑖, which is on the position 𝑗, equals 𝑎𝑖⋅(𝑗−1)+𝑏𝑖⋅(𝑛−𝑗).

The director entrusted Stas with the task: rearrange the people in the queue so that **minimize the total** *dissatisfaction*.

Although Stas is able to solve such problems, this was not given to him. He turned for help to you.

```python
# 翻译：有n个人（1～n），学生 i 有ai, bi，如果他在位置 j ，他的不满意值为 ai*(j-1) + bi*(n - j)
# 求怎么样排队列，满意值最小。
# 刚开始一只贪心，说如果sum(a) > sum(b)， 就按照a 排序等等。
# a*(j-1) + b(n-j) = (a-b)*j + b*n - a，根据公式，是按照(a-b)排序。
n = int(input())
ls = []
for i in range(n):
     ls.append([int(i) for i in input().split()])
ls.sort(key = lambda x: x[0]-x[1], reverse=True)
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
    ans += (ls[i][0]*i + ls[i][1]*(n-i-1))
print(ans)
```
